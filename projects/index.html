Prediction of Anti-Cancer Medication Discontinuation via Patient Portal Messages and Structured Electronic Medical Records, R37CA237452

Principal Investigator: Zhijun Yin
Supporting Agency: NIH/NCI (MERIT Award)
Performance Period: 05/01/2020 – 04/30/2026
Level of Funding: $2,298,657
Goals: In this project, we will analyze the online communications between patients and healthcare providers in a patient portal and apply them as well as structured electronic medical records to predict medication discontinuation.

Note: The Method to Extend Research in Time (MERIT) (R37) Award provides longer-term grant support (up to 7 years) to Early Stage Investigators (ESIs). ESI R01 applications that receive a score within the NCI payline for experienced and new investigators are eligible for consideration to be converted to an ESI MERIT Award. The two-year extension of this award was approved in 05/2024 based on the outstanding performance in the original R01 research." />
