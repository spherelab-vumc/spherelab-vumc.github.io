Who We Are?
We are a research group in the Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI) at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, affiliated with:
Health Information Privacy Laboratory (HIPLab)
Center for Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings (GetPreCise)
AI Discovery &amp; Vigilance to Accelerate Innovation &amp; Clinical Excellence (ADVANCE) Center
Motivation
Our research is motivated by a vast amount of real-world data generated by people/machines in both online and offline environments. We believe that the data, or the evidence hidden in the data, is the key to understanding personal as well as public health and well-being. While new technologies have dramatically changed the world, the nature of social interaction and isolation of human beings is deemed to be a significant factor when decoding such evidence." />

<p>We are a research group in the <strong>Department of Biomedical Informatics <a href="https://www.vumc.org/dbmi/">(DBMI)</a></strong> at <strong>Vanderbilt University Medical Center</strong>, affiliated with:</p>
<p><strong>Health Information Privacy Laboratory <a href="https://hiplab.mc.vanderbilt.edu/">(HIPLab)</a></strong><br>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Our research is motivated by a vast amount of real-world data generated by people/machines in both online and offline environments. We believe that the data, or the evidence hidden in the data, is the key to understanding personal as well as public health and well-being. While new technologies have dramatically changed the world, the nature of social interaction and isolation of human beings is deemed to be a significant factor when decoding such evidence.</p>
<h2 id="mission">Mission</h2>
<p>We aim to apply computational methods to the data that reside within/beyond electronic health records to tell stories that have strong implications for health-related behaviors, outcomes and policies. We will study the extent to which social/peer/professional support, as well as information system/technology, influences health and well-being in a long-term, dynamic, and collective manner.</p>
<p>Please feel free to send an email to zhijun [DOT] yin [AT] vumc [DOT] org if you are interested in our research or want to join us through the Vanderbilt computer science or biomedical informatics graduate program.</p>
